## About Project
The main objective of developing the current project entitled “Mind the Product” is to build an effective system which is flexible enough to incorporate any future enhancements. Back in the days a shop owner used to manage all his sales and accounts manually on paper. This project describes the system which not only records the sales but also notifies the retailer about the items low in stock. This is widely used by retailers, shopkeepers and other merchants across different businesses. This project mainly deals with the problems like availability of stock, sales of the product, time to reorder a particular product. It provides a solution of an automated system which helps to manage their stocks. Suppose a customer purchases a particular product from the store, during the billing period the product is scanned and updated in the database of the system. By this we can track the sales of the product, availability and which items to reorder. The stock management system contains 4 main modules. Firstly, the User Management module allows users to login through SSO and displays all the user specific information. It permits adding users and suppliers, and lists users and suppliers. Secondly, the Product Management module is used for managing the items being stocked in mart which includes adding, listing and printing the barcode of the products. Thirdly, the Purchase Management module manages all the purchases done by the retailer, helps in maintaining the records of all the purchases from various suppliers, internally maintains the orders and expenditures. Finally, the Sales Management module deals with the billing and other transactions which includes details about the deliveries, sales and products.
